# Grexsys-JS
Grexsys JS is a few useful JavaScript functions that I use often on different sites.  I can link to these file and use the function instead of adding a new file to every site.  Feel free to add functions or use functions.  If you have something better to improve the function by all means, do but don't render the function useless.  Keep in mind this is linked to on live sites.

It will grow over time.  Feel free to add useful snippets if they will help someone.
